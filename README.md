# URLLC with Cell-Free Massive MIMO
This repository contains the matlab numerical routines used to produce the figures in the paper:

A. Lancho, G. Durisi and L. Sanguinetti "Cell-Free Massive MIMO for URLLC: A Finite-Blocklength Analysis",  *IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun.,* 2021. 

Please, cite the aforementioned paper if you use this code. 

## Content of the repository

This repository contains two folders corresponding to the sections of the paper where the figures appear. Within each folder, a readme document
 explains how to use the functions to generate plots like the ones appearing in the paper.  

The following auxiliary matlab files have been taken from the github repository
 [https://github.com/emilbjornson/cell-free-book](https://github.com/emilbjornson/cell-free-book):
  
  - `functionChannelEstimates.m`
  - `functionCombinerPrecoder.m`
  - `functionRlocalscattering.m`
  - `generateSetup.m`
